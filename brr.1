.SH NAME
brr \- terminal speed reading tool using RSVP technique
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B brr
[\fB\-w\fR \fIwpm\fR]
.RI [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B brr
is a terminal-based speed reading tool that displays text one word at a time using the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique. Each word is displayed with its Optimal Recognition Point (ORP) highlighted in red, allowing for faster reading by reducing eye movement.
.PP
The tool accepts input from a file or standard input and allows real-time adjustment of reading speed through keyboard controls.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-w ", " \-\-wpm " " \fIwpm\fR
Set reading speed in words per minute (default: 300). Valid range is 100-1500 WPM.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display help information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.SH CONTROLS
While reading, the following keyboard controls are available:
.TP
.B SPACE
Pause or resume reading.
.TP
.BR + " or " =
Increase reading speed by 50 WPM (up to 1500 WPM maximum).
.TP
.B \-
Decrease reading speed by 50 WPM (down to 100 WPM minimum).
.TP
.B \(ua
Increase reading speed by 50 WPM (up to 1500 WPM maximum).
.TP
.B \(da
Decrease reading speed by 50 WPM (down to 100 WPM minimum).
.TP
.B \(<-
Jump to the previous sentence and pause.
.TP
.B \(->
Jump to the next sentence and pause.
.TP
.BR q " or " Q
Quit the application.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Read a file at default speed (300 WPM):
.B brr article.txt
.TP
Read a file at 500 WPM:
.B brr \-w 500 article.txt
.TP
Read from standard input:
.B cat book.txt | brr
.TP
Read at high speed (900 WPM):
.B brr \-w 900 article.txt
.SH HOW IT WORKS
The RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique works by:
.IP 1. 4
Displaying words one at a time at a fixed position
.IP 2. 4
Highlighting the Optimal Recognition Point (typically 1/3 into the word)
.IP 3. 4
Eliminating the need for eye movement across lines
.IP 4. 4
Allowing focus purely on comprehension rather than tracking
.PP
This technique can significantly increase reading speed while maintaining comprehension. Most users can comfortably read at 400-600 WPM with practice.
.SH TIPS
.IP \(bu 2
Start at 300 WPM and gradually increase speed as you become comfortable.
.IP \(bu 2
Keep your eyes focused on the center of the screen where words appear.
.IP \(bu 2
Don't try to "read ahead" or look around the screen.
.IP \(bu 2
Practice regularly to build speed and maintain comprehension.
.IP \(bu 2
Take breaks during long reading sessions to avoid eye strain.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Successful completion or user quit.
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred (file not found, invalid input, etc.).
.SH REQUIREMENTS
A terminal with ANSI color support is recommended for the best experience. The tool requires raw terminal mode support for interactive controls.
