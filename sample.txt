Speed reading is a collection of methods for increasing reading speed without an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. The many available speed-reading training programs include books, videos, software, and seminars.

The RSVP method, or Rapid Serial Visual Presentation, displays words one at a time at a fixed position on the screen. This eliminates the need for eye movement and allows readers to focus on comprehension rather than tracking text.

Research has shown that the optimal recognition point for most words is approximately one-third of the way into the word. By highlighting this point, readers can more quickly identify and process each word.

With practice, many people can comfortably read at 400 to 600 words per minute. Some trained speed readers can achieve rates of 900 words per minute or higher while maintaining good comprehension.
